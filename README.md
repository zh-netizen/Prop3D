# ðŸ§¬ Prop3D: Geometry-enhanced Representation Learning Model for Molecular Property Prediction
## ðŸ“– Introduction

**Prop3D** is a molecular representation learning model based on **3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs)**, designed to more effectively leverage the three-dimensional geometric structure of molecules for property prediction. By optimizing the decomposition of large convolutional kernels, Prop3D reduces computational overhead while enhancing modeling capacity. It also incorporates an attention mechanism to better focus on key structural features. Experimental results show that Prop3D consistently outperforms mainstream methods across various molecular property prediction tasks, demonstrating strong performance and broad applicability.
